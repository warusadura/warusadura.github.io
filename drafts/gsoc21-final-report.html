    <p>This is my last GSoC blog post. And the purpose of writing this blog post is to share the work I have completed during the past 10 weeks of Google Summer of Code 2021.</p>
<h4>Google Summer of Code 2021 Report:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Project: <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4610209823064064">GNOME/libsecret: Extend file backend to use TPM2 derived encryption keys</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The current implementation of libsecret's file backend uses an encryption key derived from the user's login password. Security wise this not an ideal situation. Because, the entire security of the file backend relies on the user's login password (single point of failure). This situation can be improved if the keys are protected/generated by hardware. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a cryptographic hardware security module (a microcontroller) that's present on modern consumer notebooks. The proposed work involves extending current libsecret file backend design to work with a TPM.</p>

<p>The following section summarize all of the merge requests I have created. You can find more information on them using the attached links.</p>
<h4>Merge Requests directly related to the GSoC Project.</h4>
<p><strong><code>merged:</code></strong> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret/-/merge_requests/86">Enable TPM emulator in CI</a></p>
<p>This is my very first merge request directly related to the GSoC project. This enables the TPM emulator inside the CI environment. This is required for testing purposes.</p>
<p><strong><code>merged:</code></strong> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret/-/merge_requests/87">Add --allow-root flag to tpm2-abrmd CI script</a></p>
<p>Related to the above merge request. This fixes an issue related to the TPM emulator execution inside the CI.</p>
<p><strong><code>merged:</code></strong> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret/-/merge_requests/83">Add TPM2 API and its implementations to egg</a></p>
<p>This is my most import work during the GSoC. This merge request defines the public TPM2 API for libsecret and adds its implementations to the incubation area (\egg directory). You can read more about this from my <a href="https://dnuka.github.io/gsoc21-internship-update.html">project update blog post</a>.</p>
<p><strong><code>merged:</code></strong> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret/-/merge_requests/91">TPM2: Fix primary key generation in decrypting</a></p>
<p>During the integration task we have discovered a bug related to primary key generation when there is no primary key present. So, this MR fixes that issue.</p>
<p><strong><code>merged:</code></strong> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret/-/merge_requests/90">Add TPM2 integration to secret file backend</a></p>
<p>This is the integration task. This merge request uses the newly define TPM2 API to extend the libsecret's file backend to use an encryption key derived from a TPM.</p>
<h4>Other Merge Requests.</h4>
<p><strong><code>wip:</code></strong> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret/-/merge_requests/93">Fix deprecated-declaration warnings</a></p>
<p>This merge request fixes the existing <code>deprecated-declarations</code> warnings generated during the libsecret <code>build</code> process.</p>
<p><strong><code>merged:</code></strong> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret/-/merge_requests/85">Remove autotools config file</a></p>
<p>This merge request removes a left over <code>autotools</code> configuration file.</p>
<p><strong><code>merged:</code></strong> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret/-/merge_requests/69">Enable static analyzer in CI</a></p>
<p>Enables two static code analyzers: <code>clang-analyzer</code> and <code>cppcheck</code> inside the CI environment.</p>
<p><strong><code>merged:</code></strong> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret/-/merge_requests/73">Fix issues flagged by static analyzers</a></p>
<p>Related to the above merge request. This merge request fixes the issues flagged by <code>clang-analyzer</code>, <code>cppcheck</code> static analyzers.</p>

<p><strong><code>merged:</code></strong> <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsecret/-/merge_requests/71">Trivial Fix: removes a comment</a></p>
<h4>Closing thoughts:</h4>
<p>I have many things to say. So, I'll start with the internship experience,</p>
<p>During my internship period I was able to accomplish many things. Completion of the project <strong>11</strong> days before the deadline is at the top. Honestly, I'm not a coding genius or anything. I was able to do this because, of my mentors <a href="https://github.com/ueno">Daiki Ueno</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ansasaki">Anderson Sasaki</a>. They both have dedicated an enormous amount of their time every single day to help with my questions. Yes, every single day. As a student from an online peer learning based university (UoPeople) I don't get to learn from a professor/instructor. Talking with my GSoC mentors was the closest professor, student experience I have ever had. They even help me to prepare for my very first presentation. So, I'm truly grateful for their support and guidance. I couldn't have done any of this without their guidance. Also, I would very much like to thank, upstream TSS developers for helping me out with all things related to TPMs. And thank you GNOME GSoC admins.</p>
<p>As for the things I have learned during the internship,</p>
<p>In my early stage of the internship, I knew nothing about libsecret, computer security, cryptography or TPMs. I just knew some C programming. So, I had to learn everything related to the project while contributing. Very recently I got to learn about C memory issues/memory leaks. Finding memory leaks and fixing them was a fun experience. I don't get why many engineers complains about them everyday on Hacker News :) Also, I got to learn about the aspects of a software engineering job. Like how/when they work and what's their day to day workflow, code reviews ... Overall, I think it's fair to say I have learned a lot from the GSoC internship.</p>
<p>If you're a someone who's thinking about applying for the next iteration of GSoC. Go ahead, it will most certainly will make a huge impact on you. I guarantee it.</p>
