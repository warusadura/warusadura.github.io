    <p>This is me trying to explain my experience when attending Software developer community events in Sri Lanka. Here goes,</p>
<p>Last year(2019) I have completed my Outreachy internship with OpenStack. Outreachy encourages us to Attending free and open source software conferences, talks and workshops for meeting other contributors and to network with them. So, I was very eager to attend The Open Infrastructure Summit, Denver, CO last year. Since I'm based in Sri Lanka, it was a hard(financially) trip to achieve. So, my one and only option was attending a local conference or workshop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka there is no free and open source software conferences. However, I got invited to attend a Google IO 2019 extended event organized by GDG Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, the event got canceled due to Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka [1].</p>
<p>Then I started to look into local meetups [2]. I was able to discover few meetups that I'm interested in. Over the past couple of months I was able to attend over 15 local meetups. To name a few(free and open source software related),</p>
<p>16/01/2020 - Hands-on Workshop: Docker, Docker Colombo</p>
<p>14/01/2020 - Kubernetes Sri Lanka 2020, Kubernetes Sri Lanka</p>
<p>17/12/2019 - Building a Complete Web App with AWS Amplify, 99X Tech</p>
<p>27/10/2019 - Privacy in the Cloud, WSO2</p>
<p>19/09/2019 - Colombo DevOps Meetup, Codegen</p>
<p>07/07/2019 - Infrastructure as Code, WSO2</p>
<p>22/06/2019 - DevOps Skills, WSO2</p>
<p>Those meetups were held in Colombo, Sri Lanka. So, I had to make a 8 hour long trips(back and forth) to each and every single meetup. Also, they were usually 2-3 hours long.</p>

<p>I have acquired a great deal of practical knowledge thanks to those events. Specifically, I was able to get to know more about free and open source software/tools such as Docker, Ansible, Git and Kubernetes (all related to my my Outreachy project [3]). Also, I was able to meet and work with enthusiastic software developers even for a limited time. Made a couple of friends too. Overall, the meetups were empowering and awesome events.</p>
